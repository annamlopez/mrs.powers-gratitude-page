      <h1> Mrs. Powers</h1>
      <p> Hi Mrs. Powers!! You may be wondering what is this?? Well I made you a webpage to show my gratitude. I was trying to decide how I was going to thank you for everything you've done for me these past four years. It felt like a simple card wouldn't suffice. Then along came Comp Sci 450. Our final is to make a webpage, we get to choose what to make the webpage about </p>
      <p class="center">and I choose you.</p>
      <button type="button" class="center">Our Backstory </button>
      <div>

      <p> Freshman year Anna and Tyson had no clue that the lady at the desk in the Dean of Studies Office would become our mom at school. We were just trying to get into architecure together (which didn't happen but was for the best) and you were there to patiently explain the process which you do too many times at the beginning of each term. Then after that we just kept coming back. Whether for the jolly ranchers, starbursts, your daily jokes, or just to talk to you, we always came back. Then it just became a habit to visit you and tell you about our days. I can't remember the first time I went to you crying but it was definitely about some boy problems. And you probably hugged me and patted my back and told me everything was going to be okay. Even during the summer when I ran into your office crying you handed me some tissues and water and sat there as I calmed down. Your office became a safe space. I knew if I was having a bad day I could go to you and you'd be there with open arms. I knew if I was upset you'd be there to listen to me rant. If I had good news you would cheer with me. You were there with us when we went to the Women's March and had the Walk Out. You let your kids at work know that you supported them, that you saw everything we were going through and stood with us. You've been there to support me during my good times and my bad times. You've been one of my biggest cheerleaders and mentors. You make sure that I've been eating and sleeping and taking care of myself. You're my mom at school. You've remained constant during my fours years at Andover and I couldn't ask for someone better. So thank you.</p>
