    <p>Ms. Powers, where do I start. What began as a relationship built strictly on candy has turned into so much more. You wear many hats for me: a confidant, a second mom, and advice giver, someone to listen to my rants, and of course a true supporter of my obsession with Marvel. I have come to not only look forward to, but also cherish our daily visits, whether it be for a quick candy run, or a long conversation. You have in many ways made my Andover career, as well as shown me a level of compassion that I have scarce experienced. I will truly miss you, and you will always be in my mind and in my heart.</p>
    <p class="center">With love,</p>

    <p>Ms. Powerssssssssss,</p>
    <p>I‚Äôd like to just say thank you for everythinggggg!! You‚Äôve always been someone who had the power to brighten up my day. Thank you for being a great listener, supporter, candy giver, customizable hearts provider, and so much more. Thank you for allowing me to take five minutes of your day to read you the daily jokes and laughing at them with me‚Äî which I will miss dearly :D. Thank you for letting me feed the fish and press the Naughty button even though it was pretty obnoxious. Thank you for just being youuuu!!!!!</p>
    <p>You will forever be my Mother Away From Home :)</p>
    <p class="center">I love you and I will definitely see you soon,</p>

    <p>Dear Ms. Powers,</p>
    <p>There is no other person that could love and nurture the way that you do. You have been a light for me on this campus despite all of my bad days here. I can not say thank you enough for how important you have been to my time here. Ms. Powers, you are one of the reasons I get up in the morning and there is not a day when I see you that I don‚Äôt smile. Being away from home and having a mother like figure like you has been so important to my growth and you make me feel so loved. I‚Äôm going to miss you so much and all of your hugs (they‚Äôre amazing) I promise to keep in touch and update you on all my adventures. I hope to love people the way that you do and make people feel as loved as you have done for all us us. </p>
    <p class="center">With all of my love,</p>

    <p>Hi Mrs. Powers, </p>
    <p>I could not be any more grateful for having you in my life. You inspire me to be a better person every day and I am glad to have met you here at Andover. Your sweetness, wholesomeness, and overall welcoming aura are the most beautiful qualities a human being could possess and I cannot express how much you helped me survive Andover. Now that I am about to graduate, I'd like to highlight that you are indeed one of the key figures on campus that extremely supported me and my only hope is that you don't change.  As you know, I'll be nearby for college and so I will occasionally be back to visit. In the meantime though, please do feel free to reach out whenever you are in Wellesley! </p>
    <p class="center">Thank you so much for everything!</p>
    <p class="center">Best,</p>

    <p>Hi Ms. Powers,</p>
    <p>You took me in the day that I met you at the Women's March, and what was that like two years ago now. You always brighten up my day when I get to see you on the path and just smile and talk to you. It's really great! Thank you so much for everything you've done for us. I love stopping by the Dean of Studies Office, grabbing some candy and getting to see you. Thank you so much!</p>
    <p class="center">Much Love,</p>

    <p>Hi Ms Powers,</p>
    <p>You know what‚Äôs funny and absurd. The first time we talked was when I was scared freshman who didn‚Äôt get her sixth course senior winter and I came to you with my slip shaking. You told me to get one more signature and I was worried you were mad at me üòÇ. It‚Äôs crazy because four years later you are one of THE kindest souls I know. I wanted to say that the universe brought us together upper year because of Anna and I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful. You have been a rock for me. Even if we don‚Äôt see each other everyday I know you‚Äôre in my corner. Thank you for feeding me and Viv when we ask you for snacks. Thank you for laughing with us about prom dates and helping me with my IP. You‚Äôre the realest ever. You saw me sobbing in one of my most stressful moment in senior fall and you just let me breathe for a minute. You gave me that blue papermate pen, allowed me to calmly fill out my form and for that I am forever grateful. Thank you for allowing me to be myself when I‚Äôm around you. I feel safe when I‚Äôm in your office. That‚Äôs may not be normal but I feel blessed to know you!</p>
    <p class="center">Only big love for you my fairy god mother üòçü§©‚ù§Ô∏è </p>

    <p>Mrs. Powers is love. Her energy never fails to bring a smile to my face. I remember when she joined us in the Women's March, unapologetically herself, chanting alongside us, I realized that she is one of us. I love her so much!</p>
    <p class="center">All the love</p>

    <p>In a school that‚Äôs so big and hard to navigate its so nice to have a friendly and welcoming face behind the front desk to help you sort it all out. Your impact on the students, however, goes far beyond your role in the dean of studies office. Your motherly love radiates throughout campus through your warm smiles, funny jokes, and kind words of encouragement. Thank you so much for looking out for me and making this crazy school feel like a home.</p>

    <p>To Mrs. Powers:</p>
    <p>You have been such a light in my life on campus for as long as I can remember. Every time I felt pissy or unhappy, I could rely on you to be sitting pretty behind your desk, ready to cheer me up and ask how I was doing. I have never had a faculty member care as deeply about my wellbeing as you have, and I am so appreciative of your positive attitude and endless affection. You are a ball of sunshine and I have so much love for you. Thank you for everything you have done for my friends and I and for all the support you have provided me with. I will carry your kindness with me forever. </p>

    <p>Ms. Powers,</p>
    <p>I appreciate the light that you bring to my day. Stopping in your office just to see you makes me happy and seeing you smile makes me believe that everything will work out. For these past four years, you have been so kind and loving to all of us. You made Andover feel like home because of the warmth and love that you spread. I will miss you so much and I hope we can keep in touch. I will make sure to visit!</p>

    <p>Ms. Powers,</p>
    <p>You were one of the first person who made me feel welcomed. When I first came to Andover I didn‚Äôt know your name or who you were. I remember walking into the Dean of Students Office confused, lost, and looking for help. You called me over and said ‚ÄúJosh, what can I do for you?‚Äù I had only been to office once before and I was shocked and humbled that you remembered my name. I want to thank you for everything you have done for us students here at Andover. For brining joy and laughter into our days and gifting us words of encouragement, support, and most importantly candy.</p>
    <p class="center">Thank you,</p>

    <p>Thank you for being my mom at school, giving amazing hugs, and always checking in on me. You give the best advice and you always know just what to say. I can‚Äôt imagine andover without you or your heart shaped notes or the endless candy supply in your office. I‚Äôll miss you immensely next year.</p>

    <p>Hi Ms. Powers,</p>
    <p>Thank you for always being there to lift me up especially when Andover kind of got me down. I‚Äôve seen how your joy rubs off on those around you.  When people are around you they just become 10x happier. Thank you for being so kind to me throughout my four years here, from giving me jolly ranchers and hearts with lovely messages to chaperoning the Women‚Äôs March and just being there to talk to. You‚Äôve had a huge impact on my time here, and I know you will continue to leave your mark on other students after we leave. Thank you for making Andover better.</p>

    <p>Hey Mrs. Powers!</p>
    <p>At whatever time you're reading this, I hope you're doing ok! Before I end my high school career at Andover and head off to college in just a few months, I wanted to thank you for everything you've done these past four years. From the first time we met to the last time I've gotten the chance to visit you in your office, I always knew I could come to and rely on you for advice, funny jokes, and a warm welcome. After each and every one of our brief, but thoughtful conversations, I always leave your office with a smile and a pocket full of candy from the goodie basket (thanks by the way!), appreciating the time I got to spend with you before ASM, after classes, and during Anna and Tyson's birthday parties. You were one of the first few faculty I actually got the chance to meet, and one of the closest I've been with ever since. Like a mother, you attract, congratulate, advise, and inspire those around you with the motivation they need to continue, even when life's felt bumpy or gotten rough. Please continue to lead a life of joyful giving and happiness spreading so that students fortunate enough to meet you such as myself will know to always keep their heads held up high and push onward. Again, thank you so much for everything, and please, promise me that you'll always continue being you!</p>
    <p class="center">Best,</p>
